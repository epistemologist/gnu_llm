We shall first suppose that there are exactly four groups of order g = p_1 p_2 ... p_\lambda, where p_1, p_2, ... p_\lambda are distinct prime numbers. If a prime factor of g which is congruent to unity with respect to another prime factor of g is thus congruent with respect to exactly two such factors then none
of the prime factors of g except the first can be thus congruent with respect to a prime factor of g. As there are exactly four groups whose common order is the product of these three prime factors every group of order g is the direct product of one of these four groups and a cyclic group which may reduce to the identity. Each of the four former groups gives rise to a cyclic quotient group with respect to the invariant subgroup whose order is the first of the three given prime numbers.
When g involves four prime factors such that each of two of them is congruent to unity with respect to one and only one of the remaining two, respectively, but not with respect to another prime factor of g, and no prime factor of g besides the two given ones is congruent to unity with respect to another prime factor of g and the larger of these two is not thus congruent with respect to the smaller, then each of the four possible groups of order g is the direct product of three groups. The third of these groups is always cyclic and may reduce to the identity while the order of each of the other two is the product of two distinct prime numbers. In each of the two given cases when there are four groups of order g this order is evidently odd and there is no upper limit to the number of its prime factors. In the remaining case this order must always be even and involve three and only three prime factors since g must then involve two odd prime numbers such that the larger is not congruent to unity with respect to the smaller and the cyclic group whose order is the product of these two primes is extended by an operator of order 2.
If there are exactly five groups of order g then the largest prime factor of g which is congruent to unity with respect to another such factor p can obviously not be thus congruent with respect to two such factors. Hence it results that either p is congruent to unity with respect to another prime factor of g or one of these other factors is thus congruent with respect to p. In the latter case there are exactly five such groups of order g if and only if p = 3 and none of the prime factors of g except the two given ones is congruent to unity with respect to such a factor and these two are thus congruent only with respect to 3. It remains to consider the case when p is congruent to unity with respect to another prime factor of g and hence there are exactly three groups whose common order is equal to these three prime factors. Therefore g must involve at least four prime factors. When either of the last two of the given three prime factors (but only one of them) is congruent to unity with respect to this fourth prime factor of g there are obviously five groups of order g and only then.
Hence, there are also three cases in which there are exactly five groups of order g when g is not divisible by the square of a prime number. In the last two of these cases each of the possible groups is the direct product of a group whose order involves four prime factors and a cyclic group which may reduce to the identity. In the first case each of the possible groups is the direct product of a group whose order involves three distinct prime factors and a cyclic group which may reduce to the identity. In all of these cases the orders of all the possible groups are odd. That is, **if there are five and only five groups of a given order which is not divisible by the square of a prime number then this order must be odd.** In what follows g will not be restricted to a number whose order is not divisible by the square of a prime number.
A necessary and sufficient condition that there are exactly four groups of order g when g = p_1^2 p_2^2 p_3 ... p_\lambda is that all the groups of this order are abelian. That is, no p_i^{\alpha i}-1, i = 1, 2, ... X is divisible by one of the primes p_1, p_2, ... p_\lambda.  The only form of g, when there are exactly four groups of order g, that remains to be considered is p_1^2 p_2 ... p_\lambda. If one and only one of the prime numbers p_2, ..., p_\lambda is congruent to unity with respect to p_1, but not with respect to p_1^2 nor with respect to another of these primes, while none of the other prime factors of g is congruent to unity with respect to such a prime factor or divides p_1 + 1, then each of the possible four groups of order g is the direct product of a group of order p_1^2 q, where q-1 is divisible by p_1 but not by p_1^2, and a cyclic group which may reduce to the identity. The fact that there cannot be more than four groups of order g when these conditions are satisfied results from the proof that such a group contains exactly p_1^2 q operators whose orders divide this number and that it could not involve p_1^2 subgroups of order q. Hence it must involve a cyclic invariant subgroup of order p_1 q since it cannot contain exactly p_1 subgroups of order q.
If one and only one of the prime numbers p_1, ..., p_\lambda is congruent to unity with respect to another one of them and this is thus congruent with respect to only one of them while none of these numbers divides p_1^2-1 nor is any of these primes congruent to unity with respect to p_1, then each of the four groups of order g is the direct product of a group of order p_1^2, a group whose order is the product of the two given prime numbers, and a cyclic group which may reduce to the identity. Hence it results that **there are six cases when there are exactly four groups of order g. In four of these cases g must be odd, in one case it must be even, while in the remaining case it may be either odd or even.**
When there are exactly five groups of order g this order may be of the form p_1^3 p_2 ... p_\lambda provided no one of these prime numbers is congruent to unity with respect to another one of them and none of the orders of the groups of isomorphisms of the various groups of order p_1^3 is divisible by one of the prime nunbers p_2,...,p_\lambda. Each of these five groups is the direct product of a group of order p_1^3 and a cyclic group, which may reduce to the identity. As there is obviously no order of the form p_1^2 p_2^2 p_3 ... p_\lambda  for which there are exactly five groups it remains only to consider the orders which are of the form p_1^2 p_2 ... p_\lambda, for which exactly five groups exist.
Suppose that g is of this form and that one and only one of the prime factors of g is congruent to unity with respect to another such factor and this is thus congruent with respect to p_1^2 but not with respect to any other prime factor of g nor does any such prime factor divide p_1^2 - 1. It is easy to prove that every group of order g must then involve exactly p2q operators whose orders divide this number, where q - 1 is divisible by p_1^2. Such a group can therefore not involve as many as p_1^2 subgroups of order q and hence it involves only one such subgroup. It results that every such group is the direct product of one of the five possible groups of order p_1^2 q and a cyclic group which may reduce to the identity. The smallest value of g for which exactly five such groups exist is 20. There are obviously also exactly five groups of order 2p_1^2, p_1 being any prime number.
When p_1 - 1 is divisible by one of the prime numbers p_2,...,p_\lambda there are always more than five groups of order g except when this prime is 2 and g reduces to 2p_1^2. Hence we may assume in what follows that p_1 is incongruent to unity with respect to each of the prime factors of g and that none of these factors is congruent to unity with respect to p_1 except when g = 12. If p_1 + 1 is divisible by two and only two of the distinct prime factors of g but no such factor is congruent to unity with respect to another then each of the possible groups of order g contains an invariant subgroup of order p_1^2 and there are five groups of order g. This is also the case when p_1 + 1 is divisible by one and only one p of these prime factors and p - 1 is divisible by one and only one such factor while none of the other prime factors of g is congruent to unity with respect to such factors. The existence of exactly five groups in these cases results almost directly from the following elementary theorem: If any group involves a cyclic Sylow subgroup of order p^m then all of its subgroups of order p^\alpha are conjugate under the group.
As there are exactly 5 groups of order 12 there are 9 cases in which there are exactly 5 groups of the given order g. In three of these cases g is not divisible by the square of a prime number, in one g is divisible by the cube of such a number, while in the remaining five, g is divisible by the square of one and only one prime number. In one and only one of these cases g is completely determined, being 12. In another case g involves only two distinct prime factors, being 2p_1^2. While in the remaining seven cases there is no upper limit to the number of distinct primes which may divide g when and only when it is odd. In fact, in five of these cases g must be odd while in the remaining two it may be either odd or even.
